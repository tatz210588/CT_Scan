# CT_Scan

Here we are making an Artificial Intelligent model (in Python), using TensorFlow, which can accept a CT scan volume of a patient's lungs and can predict whether he has a lungs cancer or not. For training our TensorFlow Model, we are using the data of 210 patients from https://nbia.cancerimagingarchive.net/nbia-search/ , which is an open-source platform.
